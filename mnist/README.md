## MNIST Tutorial

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.
In this tutorial, your goal is to correctly identify digits from the Kaggle MNIST dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

## MNIST Data Augmentation Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use data augmentation techniques to expand the set of available training data and significantly improve the performance of the standard LeNet5 CNN developed in the previous tutorial.
